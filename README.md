# 🔐 ubuntu-secure-administrator

## 📘 Project Overview

**ubuntu-secure-administrator** is a professional-level system hardening and monitoring project built on top of **Ubuntu Server 24.04.2 LTS**. It is designed for researchers, administrators, and power users who want full control over their server environments without relying on any third-party cloud services or desktop interfaces.

This project prioritizes clarity, modular security, and high observability using industry-grade tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a secure, minimal, CLI-only Ubuntu server with hardened configurations.
- Monitor system behavior using advanced `auditd` rules.
- Enforce strict network controls via `ufw` and monitor outbound/inbound traffic.
- Integrate intrusion detection with `Suricata` and tune it for clean, actionable alerts.
- Detect and log unauthorized behaviors (e.g. SSH brute-force, privilege escalation).
- Maintain full visibility into authentication, system changes, and scheduled tasks.
- Simulate a production-like micro-environment managing **up to 10 virtual or real servers**.

## 🧰 Core Tools & Stack

| Tool        | Purpose                                |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| `ufw`       | Host-based firewall control            |
| `auditd`    | Syscall-level auditing and tracking    |
| `fail2ban`  | Brute-force detection and blocking     |
| `AppArmor`  | Application-level access control (MAC) |
| `Suricata`  | Network intrusion detection (IDS)      |
| `journalctl`| Centralized log analysis               |
| `bash`      | Lightweight modular scripting          |

🌐 Target Environment

This project simulates managing and securing a real-world deployment of up to 10 Ubuntu servers, either:

    Locally via KVM (virt-manager) for lab testing.

    Or on real VPS/cloud infrastructure with minimal modifications.

It is optimized for environments where:

    GUI is unnecessary or undesired.

    Logging, auditing, and visibility take priority.

    Root-level control is essential.

    Minimal dependencies and high transparency are required.

🚀 Key Advantages

    CLI-only: no GUI, no unnecessary services.

    Modular: every component is optional and well-documented.

    Enterprise-grade: based on Red Hat, CAI, NSA, and security best practices.

    Offline-friendly: no reliance on external tools or trackers.

    GitHub-ready: clean structure, tested rules, and organized documentation.

📦 Future Features (planned)

    auditd-analyzer.sh: custom event summarizer for key audit patterns.

    VPN watchdog: alert if WireGuard disconnects or leaks occur.

    AppArmor profile generator with enforced restrictions.

    Optional integration with cron, logrotate, and notification systems.

This repository is intended to serve both as a learning environment and as a production-grade reference for secure server administration.
